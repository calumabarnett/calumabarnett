## MoJ Personal User Manual

### The times and hours I like to work ⏰

- I usually start between 10:00 and 10:30AM.
- I don't always finish at the same time but it's usually between 6:00 and 6:30PM. If I’m being productive, I’ll often keep going until quite late. Other times, I’ll wrap up earlier, but usually no earlier than 5:00.
- I’ll sometimes work late in the evenings and on weekends, especially if there’s something I just want to get done. Don't be alarmed if you get messages or emails from me at strange times – I don't expect you to respond!
- I don't tend to take a long lunch break – usually just 15 minutes. Though when it’s nice weather, I might take some extra time to sit in the park.
- I sometimes pop out for a coffee during the day.
- I don't like to have meetings before 10:00AM or after 5:00PM unless they're unavoidable.

### The best ways to communicate with me 📠

- I think face-to-face conversations (in person) are the best way of communicating.
- The best way to contact me is on the Digital & Technology Slack workspace. I also use the Data & Analysis Slack workspace but not as much.
- I don't tend to use Microsoft Teams for messaging and it's possible I'll miss things if you contact me there.
- I’m not a huge fan of emails but they’re a necessary evil sometimes. If you do email me, please use [calum.barnett@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:calum.barnett@digital.justice.gov.uk).
- I have my work phone with me throughout the day but I only use it to check Slack and emails on the go, not for calls.
- I prefer to use Google Meet for video calls but I don't mind Microsoft Teams.
- I find virtual meetings much more engaging and productive when people have their video turned on.
- I'd rather talk things through in person or on a call than have a long conversation by message or email.

### How I learn best 📚

- I learn best by doing, especially where there’s a real problem to solve that I find genuinely interesting.
- I don't take in information as well when it's provided verbally.
- I find diagrams, drawings and other visual aids helpful when trying to understand new concepts.
- I enjoy getting into technical details.
- I like to think I'm a quick learner and can pick up new concepts easily.

### The conditions I like to work in 🏢

- I like to work from the office (usually 102 Petty France) as I find it makes me much more productive. I tend to go to the office most days.
- I try to keep my work location up to date in my calendar.
- I don’t mind a noisy environment (to an extent), in fact, I find it hard to concentrate when it’s too quiet.
- I like working at a proper desk with a screen.
- I often have my headphones on but don’t take it as a sign that I shouldn’t be disturbed (unless I'm in a meeting).
- I like to have my time mapped out in my calendar.
- I like to have calendar invites even for ad-hoc and informal meetings as it helps me better track and understand how I'm using my time.
- I like to work on documents collaboratively and in real time on Google Drive or in Confluence. I don't like when documents are sent back and forth by email.
- I enjoy working together with others in person, especially when there are post-its and whiteboards involved.

### The ways I like to receive feedback 🎯

### Things I need 🧰

- I often need time to think things through and digest information before responding to something or making a decision, so I don't like being put on the spot in meetings.
